# Contributing to Chess Game

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Chess Game project! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.19 or later
- Git
- Make (optional, but recommended)

### Getting Started
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/app.git
   cd app
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```
4. Run tests to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes
1. Create a new branch for your feature/fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes
3. Run the development checks:
   ```bash
   make dev  # Runs deps, check, and test
   ```
4. Commit your changes with a descriptive message
5. Push to your fork and create a pull request

### Code Quality Standards

Our CI pipeline enforces several quality standards:

#### **Formatting and Style**
- Code must be formatted with `gofmt`
- Run `make fmt` to format your code
- Follow Go naming conventions

#### **Testing**
- All new code must include tests
- Tests must pass with race detection: `go test -race ./...`
- Aim for high test coverage (current: 97%+)
- Test files should end with `_test.go`

#### **Linting**
- Code must pass `golangci-lint` checks
- Run `make lint` to check locally
- See `.golangci.yml` for configuration

#### **Static Analysis**
- Code must pass `go vet` checks
- Run `make vet` to check locally

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Continuous Integration
Every push and pull request triggers:

1. **Multi-version Testing**: Go 1.19, 1.20, 1.21
2. **Code Quality Checks**:
   - `go vet` static analysis
   - `gofmt` formatting check
   - `golangci-lint` comprehensive linting
   - Race condition detection
3. **Security Scanning**:
   - Gosec for security vulnerabilities
   - Nancy for dependency vulnerabilities
4. **Cross-platform Builds**: Linux, macOS, Windows (AMD64/ARM64)
5. **Test Coverage**: Reports uploaded to Codecov

### Release Process
1. Create and push a version tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```
2. GitHub Actions automatically:
   - Builds cross-platform binaries
   - Creates a GitHub release
   - Uploads packaged artifacts
   - Generates release notes
